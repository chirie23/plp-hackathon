# PLP Hackathon - My Programming Journey

Welcome to my personal programming portfolio!  

## About Me
I'm Sharon, a beginner in programming with a passion for learning and problem-solving.  
My journey started with basic Python scripts, and I am now exploring data analysis, automation, and web development.  

## Project Overview
This repository contains:
- A basic Python script (`script.py`) that performs a simple addition.
- A README documenting my learning journey.
- A `.gitignore` file to keep my repository clean.
- A `LICENSE` file for open-source usage.

## Running the Script
To run the Python script, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chirie23/plp-hackathon.git
   cd plp-hackathon
